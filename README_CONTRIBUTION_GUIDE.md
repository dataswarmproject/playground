## 🎨 What LeakyReLU Does

**Problem**: Standard ReLU can cause "dying neurons" (gradients become zero)

**Solution**: LeakyReLU allows small gradient when inactive

```
ReLU:        f(x) = max(0, x)
LeakyReLU:   f(x) = x if x > 0, else 0.01 * x
             
Benefit: Prevents dead neurons during training
```

**Visual Result**: Try it with the Spiral dataset - you'll see it train successfully!
