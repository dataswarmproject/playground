## ⚡ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1️⃣ Test Your Ready-Made Contribution

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run serve-watch
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and:
- Select **"Leaky ReLU"** from the Activation dropdown
- Click the **Play button** ▶️
- Watch it train on different datasets
- Compare with standard ReLU

**✅ It works!** You have a working feature ready to contribute.

### 2️⃣ What Was Added?

I implemented **LeakyReLU activation function**:
- ✅ Math implementation in `src/nn.ts`
- ✅ State registration in `src/state.ts`
- ✅ UI dropdown option in `index.html`
- ✅ Built and tested successfully

### 3️⃣ Submit to GitHub (10 Minutes)

```bash
# Fork the repo on GitHub first!
# Visit: https://github.com/tensorflow/playground
# Click "Fork" button

# Then push your changes
git checkout -b feature/add-leakyrelu
git add src/nn.ts src/state.ts index.html
git commit -m "Add LeakyReLU activation function"
git push origin feature/add-leakyrelu

# Create PR on GitHub
# Sign Google's CLA when prompted
```

**🎊 Congratulations! You're now an open source contributor!**

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Neural Network Basics
- **Forward Propagation**: Input → Hidden Layers → Output
- **Backpropagation**: Calculate gradients backwards
- **Activation Function**: Non-linearity between layers
- **Learning Rate**: How fast weights update
- **Regularization**: Prevent overfitting (L1/L2)

### Code Architecture
- **Pure JavaScript ML**: No TensorFlow.js (educational clarity)
- **D3.js Visualization**: SVG rendering of network
- **URL State**: All settings in hash for sharing
- **Real-time**: Training happens in main thread

### What Makes a Good Contribution
✅ Focused and small
✅ Well-tested
✅ Educational value
✅ Doesn't break existing features
✅ Follows existing code style
✅ Includes comments

❌ Massive refactoring
❌ Breaking changes
❌ Adding heavy dependencies
❌ Overly complex code
