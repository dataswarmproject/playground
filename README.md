# TensorFlow Playground - Digital Trendz Fork

![Digital Trendz](https://digital-trendz.net/logo.svg)

## About This Repository

This is **Digital Trendz's** fork of the [TensorFlow Playground](https://github.com/tensorflow/playground) project, an interactive visualization tool for neural networks. We've contributed enhancements to this educational platform as part of our commitment to advancing Business Intelligence and AI technologies.

**Original Project**: [tensorflow/playground](https://github.com/tensorflow/playground)  
**Live Demo**: [playground.tensorflow.org](http://playground.tensorflow.org)

## Our Contributions

### LeakyReLU Activation Function

We've implemented the **LeakyReLU activation function** to enhance the educational value of the playground:

**Features**:
- Prevents "dying ReLU" problem in neural networks
- Allows small gradient flow for negative values (0.01 slope)
- Educational comparison with standard ReLU
- Fully integrated into the UI

**Modified Files**:
- `src/nn.ts` - LeakyReLU implementation with derivative
- `src/state.ts` - State management registration
- `index.html` - UI dropdown integration

**Testing Status**: Tested with all datasets (Circle, XOR, Gaussian, Spiral)
