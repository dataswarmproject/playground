## 📚 Project Understanding

### Architecture Overview

```
TensorFlow Playground
│
├── src/
│   ├── playground.ts     # Main app logic, UI controls
│   ├── nn.ts            # Neural network implementation
│   ├── state.ts         # State management
│   ├── dataset.ts       # Dataset generators
│   ├── heatmap.ts       # Visualization
│   └── linechart.ts     # Loss chart
│
├── index.html           # Main HTML structure
├── styles.css          # Styling
└── dist/               # Built files (generated)
```

### Key Concepts

1. **Pure JavaScript Implementation**: No TensorFlow.js or external ML libraries - this is intentional for educational clarity

2. **URL State Persistence**: All settings are stored in URL hash, so users can share configurations

3. **Real-time Visualization**: Uses D3.js to visualize network architecture, weights, and decision boundaries

4. **Educational Focus**: Code is meant to be readable and educational, not production-optimized

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Watch Mode (Recommended)
```bash
npm run serve-watch
```
This will:
- Start a dev server on http://localhost:3000
- Auto-rebuild when you change TypeScript/HTML/CSS files
- Auto-refresh the browser

### Manual Build
```bash
npm run build     # Build once
npm run serve     # Serve the dist/ folder
```

### File Structure After Build
```
dist/
├── index.html      # Copied from root
├── bundle.js       # Compiled TypeScript
├── bundle.css      # Concatenated CSS
├── lib.js          # Third-party libraries
└── analytics.js    # Google Analytics
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Before submitting any contribution, verify:

- [ ] Code compiles without errors (`npm run build`)
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Works with all datasets (Circle, XOR, Gaussian, Spiral)
- [ ] Works with different network architectures (1-6 layers, 1-8 neurons)
- [ ] URL state serialization works (refresh page preserves state)
- [ ] Tested in Chrome and Firefox
- [ ] UI is responsive and doesn't break
- [ ] Training doesn't freeze the browser
- [ ] Loss decreases over time (for reasonable configurations)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Debugging

**View network state:**
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log(network);  // View network structure
console.log(state);    // View current state
```

**Breakpoints:**
- Use browser DevTools
- Set breakpoints in `src/playground.ts` for UI events
- Set breakpoints in `src/nn.ts` for training logic

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Changes not appearing
```bash
# Solution: Hard refresh or clear cache
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

**Issue**: TypeScript errors
```bash
# View detailed errors
npm run build-js
```

**Issue**: State not persisting
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `state.serialize()` is called after changes

## 🌟 Contribution Ideas by Difficulty

### 🟢 Beginner (Good First Issue)

1. **Add Swish Activation**
   ```typescript
   public static SWISH: ActivationFunction = {
     output: x => x / (1 + Math.exp(-x)),
     der: x => {
       let sigmoid = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-x));
       return sigmoid + x * sigmoid * (1 - sigmoid);
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Add Half-Moons Dataset**
   - Similar to `classifyCircleData()` in `dataset.ts`
   - Creates two semi-circular clusters

3. **Add Export Button**
   - Button to download network weights as JSON
   - Uses `JSON.stringify()` and blob download

### 🟡 Intermediate

1. **Add Adam Optimizer**
   - Modify `updateWeights()` in `nn.ts`
   - Track momentum and adaptive learning rates

2. **Add Dropout Visualization**
   - Randomly disable neurons during training
   - Visualize which neurons are dropped

3. **Add Learning Rate Scheduler**
   - Decay learning rate over time
   - Options: step decay, exponential, cosine annealing

### 🔴 Advanced

1. **Upgrade to TypeScript 5.x**
   - Update `package.json`
   - Fix breaking changes
   - Enable strict mode

2. **Migrate to D3 v7**
   - Significant API changes
   - Rewrite all D3 code
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Add Web Workers for Training**
   - Move training loop to worker
   - Keep UI responsive during training
   - Message passing for state updates

## 🎨 Example: Adding a New Dataset

```typescript
// In src/dataset.ts

export function classifyConcentricCircles(numSamples: number, noise: number): Example2D[] {
  let points: Example2D[] = [];
  let radius = 5;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < numSamples; i++) {
    let r = randUniform(0, radius);
    let angle = randUniform(0, 2 * Math.PI);
    let x = r * Math.sin(angle);
    let y = r * Math.cos(angle);
    
    // Inner circle = positive, outer ring = negative
    let label = (r < radius * 0.5) ? 1 : -1;
    
    let noiseX = randUniform(-radius, radius) * noise;
    let noiseY = randUniform(-radius, radius) * noise;
    
    points.push({x: x + noiseX, y: y + noiseY, label});
  }
  
  return points;
}
```

Then register it in `state.ts` and add to `index.html`.
